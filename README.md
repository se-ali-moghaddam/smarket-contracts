# 🏠 Smarket – Real Estate Tokenization Smart Contracts

**Smarket** is a practice project aimed at exploring the concept of real estate tokenization on the blockchain using **Solidity**. It represents properties as on-chain digital assets, providing a foundation for decentralized asset management, ownership tracking, and potential future integrations with DeFi ecosystems.

## ✨ Features

- **ERC-1155 Token Standard with Supply Tracking**  
  Each property is represented as a unique token using the ERC-1155 standard, enabling efficient management of multiple assets and tracking the supply of fractional ownership.

- **Chainlink Functions Integration**  
  Off-chain data such as property details and real estate prices are fetched using **Chainlink Functions**, enabling dynamic token metadata and valuation updates based on trusted external sources.

- **Cross-Chain Interoperability with Chainlink CCIP**  
  The project supports **Chainlink CCIP** to explore cross-chain transfers of tokenized assets, making the system more flexible and adaptable to multi-chain environments.

- **Modular and Scalable Architecture**  
  Contracts are written with modularity in mind, allowing easy upgrades, extensions, and integration with other protocols in the future.
